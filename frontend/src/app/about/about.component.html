        <p>I'm a big fan of what's been done with boot.dev, as of right now it is the single best core path to learn how to code. Boot.dev has done something special in the gamified education space, it has dared to break the duolingo mold by offering challenging material to dedicated learners rather than offer a slightly substantive distraction to hobbyists. There is a fundamental asynchronicity is in the course that I am attempting to both demonstrate, and contribute towards a part of the solution for here.</p>
        <p>Boot.dev is first and foremost a teaching platfrom and their core competency is producing educational content, but not coding challenge problems. However, this builds a course that is fundamentally paced on the difficulty of understanding concepts, not the difficulty of writing the code to utilize the concepts. The course won't outright leave anyone in a situation where they are incapable of producing the code, but does get to a point where progress stalls, and it becomes increasingly frustrating.</p>
        <p>I've seen many learners attempt to remediate that gap by redoing courses, and this is fundamentally the wrong approach when it comes to effective learning for the following reasons:</p>
        <h2>Review != Learning</h2>
        <p>Time is a valuable resource when it comes to learning, it shouldn't be guarded over jealously, but it ought not to be wasted. One of the most common ways time spent learning is wasting is on over-reviewing by treating review the same as learning initially. Review gives us one fundamental advantage, fractional inputs. Utilizing the existing knowledge we can recall to fill in gaps is how we consolidate things into long-term memory and why the tiny spellbook entry is enough to jog your memory on a concept.</p>
        <h2>Range is King</h2>
        <p>Programming is not a memorization game, and there is no path of rote memorization of just enough techniques and concepts that will get you there. This is why reviewing the same problems over and over again does nothing for us, unless a truly significant time has passed it's just about memorizing a heuristic trick to do that task. To get better at the concept you need different exercises, stuff that's similar, but not identical, that's how we can build a generalizable mastery of a skill.</p>
        <h2>Signal to Noise</h2>
        <p>One of the other most common ways time spent learning is wasted is on reviewing the noise. Every single course in CS Fundamentals has sequences of five coding problems that are at are below average for the track, and even Learn Python has one among the hardest. If you're going to do re-do problems at least re-do the hardest stuff.</p>
